Computer Graphics Algorithms using C (Turbo C++)
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Computer Graphics algorithms using C language and BGI graphics library in Turbo C++.
It provides a menu-driven graphical interface to draw different shapes step-by-step using classic raster graphics algorithms.

🎯 Features

The program allows users to draw the following shapes:

🧵 Line Drawing Algorithms

DDA Line Algorithm

Bresenham Line Algorithm

⚪ Circle Drawing Algorithms

Bresenham Circle Algorithm

Midpoint Circle Algorithm

🥚 Ellipse Drawing Algorithm

Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm

⬛ Other Shapes

Rectangle

Triangle

Each algorithm plots pixels gradually using delay to visually demonstrate how the algorithm works internally.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Compiler: Turbo C++

Graphics Library: BGI (Borland Graphics Interface)

▶️ How to Run the Program
⚙️ Setup Instructions

Install Turbo C++

Place BGI folder inside:

C:\TURBOC3\BGI


Copy the source code file into:

C:\TURBOC3\BIN


Open Turbo C++

Compile and Run:

Ctrl + F9

📋 Menu Options
1. Line
2. Circle
3. Ellipse
4. Rectangle
5. Triangle
6. Exit


Line → DDA / Bresenham

Circle → Bresenham / Midpoint

Other shapes → Direct input coordinates

✨ Output

Shapes are drawn pixel-by-pixel on the graphics screen

Delay is added for better visualization of algorithm execution

White color is used for drawing
